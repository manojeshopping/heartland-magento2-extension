# clear cache
rm -rf /var/www/html/var/generation/*
rm -rf /var/www/html/var/cache/*

# the goal
http://magento.example.com/hello_mvc/hello/world

Apparently this directory structure
Pulsestorm/HelloWorldMVVM
means the module will be named
Pulsestorm_HelloWorldMVVM


bin/magento module:status

php bin/magento setup:upgrade



Routing in Magento 2
We’re going to make Magento 2 respond to the following URL

http://magento.example.com/index.php/hello_mvvm/hello/world
The index.php portion is optional — if you have mod_rewrite (or your web server’s equivalent) enabled, this URL is the same as

http://magento.example.com/hello_mvvm/hello/world
In Magento 2, each individual module can claim a “front name”. The “front name” is the first segment of the URL — in our case that’s hello_mvvm. When a module “claims” a front name, that is its way of saying

Another good tutorial
good for dealing with forms and db but not as in depth as alanstorm
